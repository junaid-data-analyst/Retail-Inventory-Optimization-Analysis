# Retail Inventory Optimization Analysis
## Project Overview
This project applies statistical methods to a retail dataset of 123 products to minimize stockouts, and identify inefficient inventory.
## Mathematical Logic Applied
**Safety Stock Calculation**: Safety Stock = Z * sigma * sqrt{LT}$ (where Z = 1.645 for **95%** service level).
**Dead Stock Identification**: Products with an average weekly sales volume below 13,70,000 units.
## Tools Used
**Excel**: Data Cleaning.
**SQL**: Data cleaning and aggregation.
**Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for supply chain monitoring.
